Implementation of common Software Engineering design patterns using Python


## What is a design pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Benefits of desing patterns
Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define
a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

## Classification
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition,
they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups

### Catalog of Design Patterns
1. Creational Patterns: These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

  a. Factory Method
  
  b. Abstract Factory
  
  c. Builder
  
  d. Prototype
  
  e. Singleton
  
2. Structural Patterns: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

  a. Adapter
  
  b. Bridge
  
  c. Composite
  
  d. Decorator
  
  e. Facade
  
  f. Flyweight
  
  g. proxy
  
3. Behavioural Patterns: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

  a. Chain of Resposibility
  b. Command
  
  c. Iterator
  
  e. Mediator
  
  f. Memento
  
  g. Observer
  
  h. State
  
  i. Strategy
  
  j. Template Method
  
  k. Visitor
