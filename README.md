Implementation of common Software Engineering design patterns using Python


## What is a design pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Benefits of desing patterns
Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define
a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

## Classification
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition,
they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups

### Catalog of Design Patterns
1. Creational Patterns: These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
  
2. Structural Patterns: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
  
3. Behavioural Patterns: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
